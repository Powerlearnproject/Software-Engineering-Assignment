Requirements Analysis: Identifies and records the precise requirements of the final users. This includes gathering information from stakeholders, conducting interviews, and analyzing user expectations.
Design: Outlines the software's functionality and aesthetic. This includes crafting data flow diagrams, constructing entity-relationship diagrams, and designing user interface mock-ups. The Software Design Document (SDD) serves as a roadmap for the development team.
Coding: Converts the software design into tangible code. This involves writing the code, guided by the SDD and coding guidelines. Regular code reviews ensure high code standards.
Testing: Ensures the software's robustness and reliability by conducting various types of tests, including unit testing, security testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. This phase aims to identify and fix bugs before the software is released.
Deployment: Rolls out the tested software to its end-users. This involves strategies such as Big Bang, Blue-Green, or Canary deployments to ensure minimal disruption to the user experience
Maintenance: Ensures the software's best possible functioning and longevity by adapting to changing needs. This includes responding to user feedback, resolving unexpected issues, and upgrading the software based on evolving requirements
Operations and Maintenance: Focuses on the continuous support and improvement of the software. This includes frequent software updates, implementing patches, and fixing bugs. It also involves user support and long-term strategies for upgrading or replacing the software.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile Model: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, continuous improvement, and rapid delivery. Agile involves breaking down the development process into smaller, manageable chunks, and then iteratively refining and improving each chunk. This approach is well-suited for projects with changing requirements or those that require rapid delivery
Waterfall Model: The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step. It is a more traditional approach that emphasizes a clear separation between phases and a strict adherence to the plan. This model is often used for projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed timeline

3. What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that ensures the software system being developed meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders and is developed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards
Software Design Principles:
Feasibility Study: This stage involves analyzing the technical, operational, and economic feasibility of the project to determine whether it is viable.
Requirements Elicitation: This stage involves gathering requirements from various stakeholders, such as customers, users, and domain experts, through various techniques like interviews, surveys, and observatio.
Requirements Analysis: This stage involves analyzing the gathered requirements to determine their feasibility, consistency, and completeness. It also involves identifying and resolving any conflicts or ambiguities.
 Requirements Specification: This stage involves documenting the requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner. This can include creating a requirements specification document or user stories.
Importance of Requirements Engineering:
Identify potential issues or problems early in the development process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant investments are made.
Ensure that the software is developed in a cost-effective and efficient manner.
Improve communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders.
Ensure that the software system is delivered on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit Testing
Definition: Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or units of software to ensure they meet the required functionalities.
Objective: Validate that each unit of code performs correctly and is free of bugs, errors, and glitches.
Performed by: Developers, typically during the development phase.
Advantages: Early detection of errors, reduced development time and cost, and improved code quality.

Integration Testing
Definition: Integration testing involves combining different software modules and testing them as a group to ensure that the integrated system is ready for system testing.
Objective: Verify that different components of the system function correctly at their interfaces.
Performed by: Testers.
Advantages: Detects errors between modules, ensures data flow, and reduces the risk of errors in the final product

System Testing
Definition: System testing evaluates the entire system to ensure it meets the specified requirements and criteria.
Objective: Check the system's compliance with functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, reliability, and security.
